## Typescript Definitions for Pixi.js v4 ##

This repository contains the most recent version of the declarations for pixi.js and follows the [dev branch](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/tree/dev) with periodical [Releases](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-typescript/releases) which are supposed to match pixi releases by the core team.

You may also use `npm install @types/pixi.js --save-dev` however that may be slightly outdated compared to this repository. `@types` will be updated with each tag release here.

There is active discussion on how to solve the acqusition process more efficiently. 

WIP

Any advice, suggestions or improvements would be appreciated.
